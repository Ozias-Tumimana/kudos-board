# Kudos Board — Project Specification (planning.md)

> This is the source of truth for the system. Every implementation decision in
> Milestones 1–3 implements against this document. If the code diverges, update
> this file **first**, then change the code. The goal at submission is
> **code-spec parity**: this spec describes what the system actually does.

**Stack:** React 19 + Vite (frontend) · Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL (backend) · GIPHY API for gifs.

## Section 1: Component Architecture

### Parent–child hierarchy

```
App                          (routing + global board/theme state)
├── Header                   (title / logo, links home)
├── Banner                   (hero image + tagline)
├── HomePage                 (route "/")
│   ├── SearchBar            (search input + submit + clear)
│   ├── BoardFilter          (All / Recent / Celebration / Thank you / Inspiration)
│   ├── CreateBoardButton    (opens CreateBoardModal)
│   ├── BoardGrid
│   │   └── BoardCard*       (one per board: image, title, view, delete)
│   └── CreateBoardModal     (form: title, category, author, image)
├── BoardPage                (route "/boards/:boardId")
│   ├── CreateCardButton     (opens CreateCardModal)
│   ├── CardGrid
│   │   └── Card*            (message, gif, upvotes, upvote btn, delete btn)
│   └── CreateCardModal      (form: message, gif via GIPHY search, author)
└── Footer                   (attribution)
```
`*` = rendered once per item in a list.

## Section 2: API Contracts

Base URL (dev): `http://localhost:3000`. All bodies are JSON. CORS enabled in Milestone 3.

### Boards

#### `GET /boards`
Returns all boards. Supports optional query params for filter/search.
- **Query params (optional):** `category` (`celebration` | `thank-you` | `inspiration`), `recent=true` (6 most recent), `search` (substring match on title, case-insensitive).
- **Success:** `200 OK` → `[ { id, title, category, author, imageUrl, createdAt } ]`
- **Errors:** `500` on database failure.

#### `POST /boards`
Create a board.
- **Request body:**
  | field | type | required |
  |---|---|---|
  | `title` | string | ✅ |
  | `category` | string | ✅ (one of: celebration, thank-you, inspiration) |
  | `author` | string | optional |
  | `imageUrl` | string | optional (default placeholder if omitted) |
- **Success:** `201 Created` → the created board object.
- **Errors:** `400` if `title` or `category` missing/invalid; `500` on db failure.

#### `GET /boards/:id`
Get one board (without cards).
- **Success:** `200 OK` → board object.
- **Errors:** `404` if no board with that id; `500`.

#### `DELETE /boards/:id`
Delete a board (and cascade-delete its cards).
- **Success:** `200 OK` → `{ message: "Board deleted" }` (or `204 No Content`).
- **Errors:** `404` if not found; `500`.

### Cards

#### `GET /boards/:id/cards`
Get all cards for a board.
- **Success:** `200 OK` → `[ { id, message, gifUrl, author, upvotes, boardId, createdAt } ]`
- **Errors:** `404` if board not found; `500`.

#### `POST /cards`  *(or `POST /boards/:id/cards`)*
Create a card on a board.
- **Request body:**
  | field | type | required |
  |---|---|---|
  | `message` | string | ✅ |
  | `gifUrl` | string | ✅ (selected via GIPHY) |
  | `author` | string | optional |
  | `boardId` | int | ✅ (if not in URL path) |
- **Success:** `201 Created` → the created card (`upvotes` defaults to 0).
- **Errors:** `400` if `message`, `gifUrl`, or `boardId` missing; `404` if board not found; `500`.

#### `PATCH /cards/:id/upvote`
Increment a card's upvote count by 1.
- **Request body:** none.
- **Success:** `200 OK` → updated card with new `upvotes`.
- **Errors:** `404` if card not found; `500`.

#### `DELETE /cards/:id`
Delete a card.
- **Success:** `200 OK` → `{ message: "Card deleted" }` (or `204`).
- **Errors:** `404` if not found; `500`.

> **Filtering & search live on `GET /boards`** via query params (above). Frontend
> may instead filter/search client-side; if so, note that change here at impl time.

## Section 3: Database Schema Spec

Two models. `Board` has many `Card`s; deleting a board cascades to its cards.

### Board
| field | type | required | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Int | ✅ | `@id @default(autoincrement())` |
| `title` | String | ✅ | |
| `category` | String | ✅ | celebration / thank-you / inspiration |
| `author` | String | optional | `String?` |
| `imageUrl` | String | optional | `String?`; placeholder default in app |
| `createdAt` | DateTime | ✅ | `@default(now())` — used for "Recent" filter |
| `cards` | Card[] | — | relation (one-to-many) |

### Card
| field | type | required | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Int | ✅ | `@id @default(autoincrement())` |
| `message` | String | ✅ | |
| `gifUrl` | String | ✅ | from GIPHY |
| `author` | String | optional | `String?` |
| `upvotes` | Int | ✅ | `@default(0)` |
| `createdAt` | DateTime | ✅ | `@default(now())` |
| `boardId` | Int | ✅ | foreign key |
| `board` | Board | — | `@relation(fields: [boardId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)` |

**Relationship:** `Board (1) ──< (many) Card`. `onDelete: Cascade` so deleting a board removes its cards.

---

## Section 4: State Architecture

| State variable | Type / initial | Owner | Updated when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `boards` | `Board[]` / `[]` | HomePage (or App) | on mount (GET /boards); after create/delete board |
| `filter` | string / `"all"` | HomePage | user clicks a category in BoardFilter |
| `searchQuery` | string / `""` | HomePage | user submits search; cleared → `""` shows all |
| `isCreateOpen` (board) | bool / `false` | HomePage | CreateBoardButton click (open) / modal close |
| `board` | `Board \| null` / `null` | BoardPage | on mount (GET /boards/:id) |
| `cards` | `Card[]` / `[]` | BoardPage | on mount; after create/delete/upvote card |
| `isCreateOpen` (card) | bool / `false` | BoardPage | CreateCardButton click / modal close |
| `selectedGif` | string / `""` | CreateCardModal | user picks a gif from GIPHY results |
| `gifResults` | array / `[]` | CreateCardModal | GIPHY search returns results |
| `loading` | bool / `false` | HomePage, BoardPage | before/after each fetch |
| `error` | string / `""` | HomePage, BoardPage | a fetch fails |
| `theme` *(stretch)* | `"light"`/`"dark"` | App | dark-mode toggle; persisted to localStorage |

**Data flow:** State lives in the page that owns the data (HomePage owns `boards`,
BoardPage owns `cards`). Children receive data via props and report user actions
upward via callback props (`onCreate`, `onDelete`, `onUpvote`). After a mutating
API call succeeds, the owner re-fetches or updates state locally so the UI updates
without a manual refresh.

## Decisions Log — Frontend (Milestone 1)
<!-- Fill in after building the frontend. -->
- **Component that diverged most from the original spec**:
  **What I changed**:
- **State variable I needed that wasn't in the original spec**:
  **Which component owns it**:
- **Prop that didn't match the API response shape and required adjustment**:

## Spec Reconciliation — Backend (Milestone 2)
<!-- Fill in after building the backend. -->
### Endpoints verified
- `GET /boards` —
- `POST /boards` —
- `DELETE /boards/:id` —
- `GET /boards/:id/cards` —
- `POST /cards` —
- `PATCH /cards/:id/upvote` —
- `DELETE /cards/:id` —
### Schema verified against spec
- Board model fields match planning.md schema spec:
- Card model fields match planning.md schema spec:
- Relationship (Board → Cards) correct:
### Gaps found and resolved
### Intentional spec updates made during backend implementation

## Final Spec Reconciliation — Full Pipeline (Milestone 3)
<!-- Fill in after connecting frontend + backend. -->
### Frontend fetch calls verified against API contracts
- `GET /boards` (home page load):
- `POST /boards` (create board):
- `DELETE /boards/:id`:
- `GET /boards/:id/cards`:
- `POST /cards`:
- `PATCH /cards/:id/upvote`:
- `DELETE /cards/:id`:
### Integration gaps found and resolved
### State architecture verified
### Final code-spec parity assessment
